      <title>Providing Valuable Feedback Online</title>
      <link>https://kate-pyper.github.io/post/giving-feedback-online/</link>

      <guid>https://kate-pyper.github.io/post/giving-feedback-online/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://kate-pyper.github.io/post/student-reflection-for-feedback/&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; I was thinking about how to get useful feedback from students by asking them to reflect on their learning once a week. This week I&amp;rsquo;m going to make a note on the mechanisms that I have put in place for students to get feedback on their own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trickiest part of this for me has been trying to balance giving valuable and insightful feedback with maintaining a reasonable work load. Initially I had thought about asking students to submit an assignment each week that I would mark and give back to them, but it was pointed out by one of my colleagues that this would be a lot of work for me each week. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to find something that falls somewhere in the middle of that balance, with a mixture of opportunities for automated feedback and more personalised feedback, as well as assessment being provided in multiple different forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02602938.2012.691462?casa_token=dC_YZ5qUeTcAAAAA%3AxwI4kl-TEUpXwNiKxAxMDatzSqVBrgT_7DfWEUXTltJqBDkMP0W1JMpdey0zj4BBsKR7J8OSJZeQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; highlights the importance of allowing students space to reflect on their learning (which I&amp;rsquo;m doing), as well as providing various mechanisms for feedback. With that in mind I am proposing three main broad opportunities for feedback which I&amp;rsquo;ve described below. Each of these broad categories will have multiple activity types associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;weekly-qa-forums--email&#34;&gt;Weekly Q&amp;amp;A Forums &amp;amp; Email&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m planning on highlighting the forums and e-mail correspondence as opportunities for feedback this year. In my experience (and from speaking to some of my colleagues) students often think of feedback as being comments on a submitted piece of work, rather than responses to questions about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want these activites (although primarily the Q&amp;amp;A forums) to be seen as a mechanism for feedback as well as a study resource. I think that this may help to encourage the students to participate in the Q&amp;amp;A forum. I also want to encourage students to participate in these by answering each others questions, although I am less optimistic about this, based on my own experiences and those of my colleagues. I want to do some further reading on the subject, so watch this space for a blog post about using forums in online learning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;activities-built-into-content&#34;&gt;Activities Built into Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have chosen to structure my material in a &amp;ldquo;see one do one&amp;rdquo; format, where the students will be given some information and will then be given a related task to do. The plan is that these will take the form of multiple choice quizzes, interactive elements powered by either 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://shiny.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Shiny&lt;/a&gt; or 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://h5p.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;H5P&lt;/a&gt; or an interactive programming exercise. I currently use Datacamp Lite, but am hoping to transition to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;learnr tutorials&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;I&amp;rsquo;m just waiting on the neccesary infrastructure to be in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within these elements, I want to make the feedback as valuable as possible. With that in mind it is key that the students get more than just whether their answer was right or wrong. the programming exercises allow you to build this in and direct the student to where they should consider changing their code, and allows me to incorporate feedback to encourage best practice in programming. Similarly it is straightforward to incorporate valuable feedback into multiple choice questions by correcting the reasoning that would lead to a student selecting each wrong answer. This is something that should be considered when designing the questions. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/writing-good-multiple-choice-test-questions/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This guide is pretty useful&lt;/a&gt; although constructing appropriate alternatives will be very context specific. H5P will be treated similarly to quizzes but will be more appealing and will add some more variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shiny applications are more challenging. With these, the idea is to build the feedback into the app responses, so that students can see the results of changing different parameters (and hopefully come to their own conclusions). This type of feedback is less &amp;ldquo;in your face&amp;rdquo;, but still very useful from an 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wellesley.edu/sites/default/files/assets/departments/pltc/files/faculty/lewis_williams_1994_experiential-learning-past-and-present.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;experiential learning&lt;/a&gt; point of view. These apps will be combined with other activities (e.g. programming exercises or discussion forums), though these will depend on the specific learning outcome that is associated with the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that the feedback provided by all of these will be useful for sparking discussion, both during live sessions and within the Q&amp;amp;A forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;weekly-formative-assessment&#34;&gt;Weekly Formative Assessment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also building a weekly assessment into the course. These won&amp;rsquo;t contribute to the final mark, since any changes to the assessment would need to be approved. Given the number of other changes that I&amp;rsquo;m making right now, I felt that going through the process to add these quizzes into the summative assessment would be too much. If these are successful then I may consider incorporating these into the course assessment in the future. Nevertheless, these are being planned to provide the students with additional feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These assessments will be a mixture of quizzes and submissions. The quizzes would cover a week&amp;rsquo;s worth of materials and the submissions would be more involved and would cover more materials. I am aiming to make the submission examples similar to what might be seen in the mid-semester class test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help with giving feedback on the submissions, and in the interest of balancing workload and balance, I am currently looking into using rubrics a bit more. I have found 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teachersfirst.com/lessons/rubrics/index.cfm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this resource&lt;/a&gt; to be a really good guide so far. However, I am concerned that students may depend on having a  rubric for assignments and will focus on this rather than understanding course content. I had a scan through 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bearworks.missouristate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3981&amp;amp;context=theses&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this masters thesis&lt;/a&gt; which specifically focusses on the use of rubrics, and the literature seems to indicate that students like rubrics, and find them to be useful reflective tools. In addition to this it is suggested that the use of rubrics may help to relieve anxiety around teacher expectations of assignments. The more I have looked into using rubrics, the more I have realised that I need to learn about them. It seems that to be really effective the content of the rubrics has to be clearly and carefully planned&amp;hellip;another future blog post perhaps! I think, if done properly, the short term effort will be worth it in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning to use these formative assessments as a mechanism for feedback from the students to me. This will help me to assess the impact of the feedback exercises that are contained within activities earlier in the week. It will also, when combined with the activities embedded within the course material and the weekly reflections, give me an overview of the particular sticking points that students are coming across and will help me to address these in a useful way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting Feedback from Student Reflection</title>
      <link>https://kate-pyper.github.io/post/student-reflection-for-feedback/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kate-pyper.github.io/post/student-reflection-for-feedback/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my quest to provide a happy and helpful virtual classroom, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been thinking a lot about feedback. I know that it is important for me to give students timely and useful feedback, and I&amp;rsquo;m building that in to various aspects of the class. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been focussed on getting useful feedback from students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being an undergrad student and being asked at the end of a course to fill out a feedback form. I also remember finding that really annoying because I don&amp;rsquo;t get to see the benefit of any of that feedback. I wanted to make the effort to change things that students needed help with as the course progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my regression class last year I tried to collect more feedback, and asked students to fill in a short (four questions) questionnaire each week online. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly successful - out of a class of around 200 I would get around 10 responses each week. However, I will say that the responses the I did get helped me to either make useful changes to the course material (e.g. adding video content or additional exercises where people highlighted issues) or to address why I was teaching things in a particular way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m planning on still seeking weekly feedback, but I want this feedback to feel more student centred and I want to encourage students to reflect on how they feel about the course material. Student self-reflection has been indicated to help students see links in their studies, and take more responsibility for their learning (see 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/transforming-assessment-and-feedback/self-reflection#:~:text=Why%20is%20student%20self%20reflection%20important%3F&amp;amp;text=Research%20shows%20that%20a%20combination,time%2Dconsuming%20appeals%20and%20complaints.&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108008/chapters/Learning-Through-Reflection.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jstor.org/stable/42923742?seq=6#metadata_info_tab_contents&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1146193&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a few examples). In the feedback, I want to focus on their own self-perception and their perceptions about the material rather than my performance, again trying to encourage the students to think about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feedback-structure&#34;&gt;Feedback Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Feedback_activity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;feedback module&lt;/a&gt; in moodle to collect responses. The responses will be anonymous, and the questions will be split into two sections; one part that I won&amp;rsquo;t look at in detail, another that I will look at in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;part-1-reflection-on-effort-and-understanding&#34;&gt;Part 1: Reflection on Effort and Understanding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first section, which I only plan on looking at over the class as a whole, asks the students to reflect on how much effort they have put in over the week and how they would rate their understanding. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that the anonymity of the feedback module will encourage students to think honestly about this, which will therefore drive some level of student responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first part consists of two multiple choice questions as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./effort_understanding.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first question, it is relevant to note that I&amp;rsquo;ve designed the online materials to take somewhere between 6 and 8 hours, to keep it roughly in line with the 6 hours of contact time that they would get if they were taking the class face-to-face. The course is a 20 credit model spread over 10 weeks, so in theory the students would be expected to spend 20 hours per week on the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this course is aimed at MSc students, I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly concerned with individual time management, but would be interested to see how much time students spend on the materials overall. I may reconsider this when I modify this course for the second year undergraduates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second question is about the student reflecting on their own understanding. I&amp;rsquo;m asking students to use this as a reflection tool and this isn&amp;rsquo;t something that I&amp;rsquo;ll look into beyond the overall class level. I&amp;rsquo;m also considering adding my contact details to this question to encourage students who would place their understanding in the bottom three categories to contact me to arrange a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;part-2-reflection-on-the-materials&#34;&gt;Part 2: Reflection on the Materials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second section will ask the students to reflect on the materials. There will be four questions (technically one is a sub-question) which allow the students to identify areas that they would like more information, areas that they felt were good and areas where they feel that some improvement could be made. These can be seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./Materials.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried to be careful with the wording of these questions, so that they take me out of the equation and put the ownership onto the students and what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two questions are grouped together, and identify the concepts that students want more information about. This allows the students to identify areas where they need to focus their energy, and will also give me the opportunity to update materials where indicated by several students, or add information to the Q&amp;amp;A thread discussed 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://kate-pyper.github.io/post/first-step-to-blended/&#34;&gt;in my previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next question asks students to identify activities that they have found most useful. This will encourage the students to think about what they have found more straightforward. By asking &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m trying to encourage information about specifically what is good. I can then use this information to enrich other activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final question asks students about what acitivites could be (should be?) improved. This will (I hope) help students to identify sticking points in the materials, and will help them to develop an understanding of how they learn best. I am trying to ellicit a bit more information by asking what they would change about the activity. This information, again will be valuable in helping me to identify things in each activity that I should by trying to avoid doing (and potentially replace these aspects with ideas from the previous question.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-aspects-of-feedback&#34;&gt;Other Aspects of Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already mentioned that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly interested in using this to look at individual student performance or engagement. I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented some more automatic tools for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;student-performance&#34;&gt;Student Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the class I&amp;rsquo;m implementing a weekly quiz, which will cover all aspects of the materials from the week. I&amp;rsquo;m planning on using a mixture of question types, including open ended questions that I&amp;rsquo;ll mark and provide feedback on. Within questions that allow automated feedback I&amp;rsquo;ll provide detailed and specific feedback. I also want to encourage students to reach out if they are unsure of where they have gone wrong, or if their quiz mark is not what they had expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use this to identify students who need additional support, so that I can try to encourage these students to ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;student-engagement&#34;&gt;Student Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always a bit more difficult to measure student engagement. How do you know if a student has actually watched a video or read some text? (spoiler: you don&amp;rsquo;t really.) Moodle contains the option to add a completion progress block to your class page (note that the completion block shown below is from a class with two weeks&amp;rsquo; worth of activities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./completion_tracking.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each block corresponds to an activity, and will turn yellow for partially completed activities and green for completed activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on using this, along with sensibly defined parameters for completion tracking in each activity to monitor student engagement (e.g. completed lesson or require a page to be viewed). Since I&amp;rsquo;m only trying to get a general overview of student completion this is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
