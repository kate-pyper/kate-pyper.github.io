      <p>In my 
<a href="/post/student-reflection-for-feedback/student-reflection-for-feedback/">last post</a> I was thinking about how to get useful feedback from students by asking them to reflect on their learning once a week. This week I&rsquo;m going to make a note on the mechanisms that I have put in place for students to get feedback on their own work.</p>
<p>The trickiest part of this for me has been trying to balance giving valuable and insightful feedback with maintaining a reasonable work load. Initially I had thought about asking students to submit an assignment each week that I would mark and give back to them, but it was pointed out by one of my colleagues that this would be a lot of work for me each week. I&rsquo;ve tried to find something that falls somewhere in the middle of that balance, with a mixture of opportunities for automated feedback and more personalised feedback, as well as assessment being provided in multiple different forms.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02602938.2012.691462?casa_token=dC_YZ5qUeTcAAAAA%3AxwI4kl-TEUpXwNiKxAxMDatzSqVBrgT_7DfWEUXTltJqBDkMP0W1JMpdey0zj4BBsKR7J8OSJZeQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This article</a> highlights the importance of allowing students space to reflect on their learning (which I&rsquo;m doing), as well as providing various mechanisms for feedback. With that in mind I am proposing three main broad opportunities for feedback which I&rsquo;ve described below. Each of these broad categories will have multiple activity types associated with them.</p>
<h2 id="weekly-qa-forums--email">Weekly Q&amp;A Forums &amp; Email</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning on highlighting the forums and e-mail correspondence as opportunities for feedback this year. In my experience (and from speaking to some of my colleagues) students often think of feedback as being comments on a submitted piece of work, rather than responses to questions about their work.</p>
<p>I want these activites (although primarily the Q&amp;A forums) to be seen as a mechanism for feedback as well as a study resource. I think that this may help to encourage the students to participate in the Q&amp;A forum. I also want to encourage students to participate in these by answering each others questions, although I am less optimistic about this, based on my own experiences and those of my colleagues. I want to do some further reading on the subject, so watch this space for a blog post about using forums in online learning!</p>
<h2 id="activities-built-into-content">Activities Built into Content</h2>
<p>I have chosen to structure my material in a &ldquo;see one do one&rdquo; format, where the students will be given some information and will then be given a related task to do. The plan is that these will take the form of multiple choice quizzes, interactive elements powered by either 
<a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiny</a> or 
<a href="https://h5p.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H5P</a> or an interactive programming exercise. I currently use Datacamp Lite, but am hoping to transition to 
<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learnr tutorials</a>&hellip;I&rsquo;m just waiting on the neccesary infrastructure to be in place.</p>
<p>Within these elements, I want to make the feedback as valuable as possible. With that in mind it is key that the students get more than just whether their answer was right or wrong. the programming exercises allow you to build this in and direct the student to where they should consider changing their code, and allows me to incorporate feedback to encourage best practice in programming. Similarly it is straightforward to incorporate valuable feedback into multiple choice questions by correcting the reasoning that would lead to a student selecting each wrong answer. This is something that should be considered when designing the questions. 
<a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/writing-good-multiple-choice-test-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This guide is pretty useful</a> although constructing appropriate alternatives will be very context specific. H5P will be treated similarly to quizzes but will be more appealing and will add some more variety.</p>
<p>The Shiny applications are more challenging. With these, the idea is to build the feedback into the app responses, so that students can see the results of changing different parameters (and hopefully come to their own conclusions). This type of feedback is less &ldquo;in your face&rdquo;, but still very useful from an 
<a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/sites/default/files/assets/departments/pltc/files/faculty/lewis_williams_1994_experiential-learning-past-and-present.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiential learning</a> point of view. These apps will be combined with other activities (e.g. programming exercises or discussion forums), though these will depend on the specific learning outcome that is associated with the activity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that the feedback provided by all of these will be useful for sparking discussion, both during live sessions and within the Q&amp;A forums.</p>
<h2 id="weekly-formative-assessment">Weekly Formative Assessment</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m also building a weekly assessment into the course. These won&rsquo;t contribute to the final mark, since any changes to the assessment would need to be approved. Given the number of other changes that I&rsquo;m making right now, I felt that going through the process to add these quizzes into the summative assessment would be too much. If these are successful then I may consider incorporating these into the course assessment in the future. Nevertheless, these are being planned to provide the students with additional feedback.</p>
<p>These assessments will be a mixture of quizzes and submissions. The quizzes would cover a week&rsquo;s worth of materials and the submissions would be more involved and would cover more materials. I am aiming to make the submission examples similar to what might be seen in the mid-semester class test.</p>
<p>To help with giving feedback on the submissions, and in the interest of balancing workload and balance, I am currently looking into using rubrics a bit more. I have found 
<a href="https://www.teachersfirst.com/lessons/rubrics/index.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this resource</a> to be a really good guide so far. However, I am concerned that students may depend on having a  rubric for assignments and will focus on this rather than understanding course content. I had a scan through 
<a href="https://bearworks.missouristate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3981&amp;context=theses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this masters thesis</a> which specifically focusses on the use of rubrics, and the literature seems to indicate that students like rubrics, and find them to be useful reflective tools. In addition to this it is suggested that the use of rubrics may help to relieve anxiety around teacher expectations of assignments. The more I have looked into using rubrics, the more I have realised that I need to learn about them. It seems that to be really effective the content of the rubrics has to be clearly and carefully planned&hellip;another future blog post perhaps! I think, if done properly, the short term effort will be worth it in the long run.</p>
<p>I am planning to use these formative assessments as a mechanism for feedback from the students to me. This will help me to assess the impact of the feedback exercises that are contained within activities earlier in the week. It will also, when combined with the activities embedded within the course material and the weekly reflections, give me an overview of the particular sticking points that students are coming across and will help me to address these in a useful way.</p>
