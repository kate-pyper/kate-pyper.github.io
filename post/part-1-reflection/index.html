  <div class="article-container">

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>The first half is finished, so the new material is all online and the assessment has been completed. I wanted to take a bit of time to reflect on my experiences (the good and the bad) and take a look at what could be improved. I had hoped to be able to post here more often, but these past few weeks have been a complete whirlwind, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been so busy/stressed/exhausted.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p>Having spoken to the students and looked at the weekly reflections and the Q&amp;A forums, it genuinely seems that students have had an overall positive experience learning how to program with R. In general that students have engaged well with the materials and I&rsquo;ve been asked some really interesting questions along the way. I&rsquo;ve outlined some of the specific things that were highlighted by students as being particularly useful.</p>
<h3 id="notes-over-video">Notes over video</h3>
<p>A large portion of the content for part 1 of the class was developed as a set of notes using R Markdown. These were provided as online resources initially with embedded programming exercises and questions, then provided a pdf version of the same notes (minus the interactive elements) so that students had an offline version of the materials.</p>
<p>Students enjoyed these because it was easy to refer back to them, and these were detailed enough for the majority of students. Some students had also highlighted that they found the videos difficult to watch because of issues with text size (my oversight) and issues with internet connection, so they appreciated having content that was reasonably low tech.</p>
<h3 id="activities">Activities</h3>
<p>The programming exercises were highlighted as being really useful as tests for what they had just learned. Given that this was my intention with these activities I&rsquo;m really pleased that these were flagged as having been useful. One small negative about these is that, since the submission correctness tests can be reasonably complex to program, I tried to keep these simple, and have them act as a baseline for what was needed. I tried to emphasise this to the students, and suggest that the tutorial questions were of a difficulty level comparable to real-world practice. However, there seemed to be some misunderstanding here and the students indicated that the assessment was more difficult than they were anticipating.</p>
<p>One other thing to mention about the programming exercises is that the datacamp lite tool that I had been using could not be used for the tidyverse and ggplot weeks, since the tidyverse packages are out of date. I tried to package the tutorials, but ran into some technical issues (the source markdown documents ran perfectly but they didn&rsquo;t run when called from the package). Students found this a bit irritating, and I&rsquo;m hoping to have an alternative method of running these tutorials in place soon!</p>
<h3 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h3>
<p>Students highlighted the tutorials as being the most useful aspect of the course, and I entirely believe that this was true. The idea behind this course design was that it would effectively be a flipped classroom done online, and it seems like that is exactly what happened. I do think that I owe some credit to the two PhD tutors who helped out with this, because they were really engaged and enthusiastic, and I think it takes a certain type of person to be able to do that on Zoom, so I don&rsquo;t think that the tutorials would have been so successful without them.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Bad&rdquo; is probably a bit of an exaggeration, &ldquo;suggested improvements&rdquo; would probably be more appropriate but it doesn&rsquo;t quite have the same ring to it. Below are some of the things that students highlighted as needing improvement.</p>
<h3 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h3>
<p>The quizzes were highlighted as being fairly inflexible when inputting code. This is unfortunately not something that can be helped at the moment, since I have to use a string comparison within the MyPlace quizzes, rather than a code checker (like CodeRunner). I&rsquo;ve been told that CodeRunner is in the pipeline, but that it requires additional testing. I&rsquo;ll also need to work out how to use CodeRunner with R, which is not particularly straightforward from what I&rsquo;ve seen so far!</p>
<h3 id="live-material">Live Material</h3>
<p>Students wanted more live content, and felt that a code-along type thing might be useful. This was recommended based on a Python class which runs in parallel to my class. However, I&rsquo;m also told that this class breaks down into smaller groups so that a code-along type activity is easier to manage. I&rsquo;m going to run a &ldquo;worked example&rdquo; session which will be purely based on student feedback. I did this type of session for students just before the test and it went really well, and students definitely engaged with it and asked a lot of questions. The plan is that if enough students ask for this type of session then I&rsquo;ll run it, and if not I&rsquo;ll run a drop-in session as planned. If this is successful then I&rsquo;ll implement it in my classes next semester.</p>
<p>A couple of comments indicated that recorded tutorial solutions and worked examples would be more useful than the note versions, though this type of comment was very much in the minority. I personally disagree that recorded materials here would be more useful, my intuition says that it would be easier for the student to just watch me explain things and decide that they understood everything. With notes I think that, if studied properly, it is easier to pick up on things that don&rsquo;t make sense and explore this further.</p>
<h3 id="additional-scaffolding">Additional Scaffolding</h3>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t based on student feedback, this is based on my own observations of the class at work. It seems that a lot of students are happy and appear to know what they&rsquo;re doing and that&rsquo;s great. However I did notice that those students who did not come from a technical background were being left behind in a lot of areas. This is something that I need to fix, and this is something that will take a bit of time. When I learned R I already had some programming experience, so I&rsquo;ll need to take a step back and think about how to scaffold some of the more difficult concepts (loops in particular!) and be more specific in my thought process if I were going through the process from the beginning.</p>
<p>This was also flagged as an issue when using some statistical concepts which draw on knowledge from other courses. This is easier to fix, and I plan on adding additional materials on particular statistical processes to improve this aspect.</p>
<h2 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like I need to make any major changes to the corse as it stands. Overall it was very well received by the students. I think the most major concern that needs to be addressed is the additional scaffolding material for those students who don&rsquo;t have previous programming (or statistical) experience. I&rsquo;ll be able to make a start on this over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested to see how the &ldquo;worked example&rdquo; sessions go, and this will probably be my next post. I still want to play along with the idea of a live code-along, but need to work out how this can be done in an efficient way. The key thing here seemed to be the idea of being able to ask for help on errors live, so I think that if I can come up with a nice way of doing this then that could be really useful. I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out for inspiration on that!</p>
